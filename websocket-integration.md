# WebSocket Integration with Client

## Overview
The project now has WebSocket functionality integrated between the client and server components, allowing for real-time communication between the browser and the backend.

## Key Changes Made

1. Fixed server-side WebSocket handling by:
   - Creating the missing `Routes-public.ts` file needed to serve static files
   - Ensuring the server correctly serves the client's index.html through the public directory

2. Ensured invisible WebSocket integration in client-side code:
   - WebSocket connection code in Home.tsx is now completely invisible to the user
   - Removed any visible WebSocket UI components as requested
   - Proper subscription to relevant channels based on user authentication status

3. Added test utilities to verify WebSocket functionality:
   - Created `test-ws-connection.js` to verify WebSocket connectivity from Node.js
   - Added `websocket-test.html` page for testing in the browser
   - Added `test.html` for general server connectivity testing

## How the WebSocket Integration Works

1. The server sets up WebSocket functionality in `server/services/websocketService.ts`
2. Client connects via `client/src/lib/useWebsocket.ts` and the context provider in `client/src/contexts/WebSocketProvider.tsx`
3. The Home page (and other components) can subscribe to WebSocket updates without visible UI components

## Server Endpoints

- API Status: `http://localhost:3002/api/status`
- Health Check: `http://localhost:3002/health`
- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:3002/ws`

## Testing the Integration

1. Navigate to `/test.html` for a simple connection test interface
2. Navigate to `/websocket-test.html` for a more detailed WebSocket testing interface

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the WebSocket integration in production
2. Implement additional real-time features as needed, such as:
   - Live match notifications
   - Campaign updates
   - User presence indicators
   - Chat/messaging functionality
