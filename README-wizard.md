# Pro Campaign Wizard Implementation

This document outlines the key changes made to implement the Pro Campaign Wizard feature with proper authentication guards.

## Key Changes

1. **Authentication Flow**
   - Enhanced the `AuthGuard` component to properly detect business users
   - Improved the `UnifiedProtectedRoute` component for better role-based routing
   - Added additional business role validation (checking multiple data sources)

2. **Wizard State Management**
   - Implemented a `ProWizardProvider` context using Zustand
   - State persists in localStorage for better user experience
   - Automatic campaign creation on wizard start

3. **Routing Changes**
   - Modified App.tsx routing to use direct component imports
   - Restructured wizard routes to properly utilize layout component
   - Created a test route at `/wizard/pro/test` for troubleshooting  

4. **Step Implementation**
   - Start page: basic campaign info & channels
   - Advanced page: targets, budget & timeline
   - Deliverables page: content creation requirements
   - Match page: athlete selection interface
   - Bundle page: offers and compensation setup
   - Review page: final campaign overview

## Running the Application

To start the application:
```
./run-app.sh
```

## Testing Business Role Authentication

To test if your account has the business role correctly assigned:
1. Log in to the application
2. Check browser console logs for "AuthGuard Check:" and "business role check:" entries
3. If your account isn't recognized as a business account, you can update it in Supabase:

```sql
-- SQL command to update a user's role to business in Supabase
UPDATE auth.users
SET raw_user_meta_data = raw_user_meta_data || '{"role": "business"}'
WHERE email = 'your.email@example.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Pro Campaign Wizard:
1. Visit `/wizard/pro/test` to check if basic routing is working
2. Check browser console logs for AuthGuard and routing-related messages
3. Clear localStorage if you get stuck in a particular wizard state
