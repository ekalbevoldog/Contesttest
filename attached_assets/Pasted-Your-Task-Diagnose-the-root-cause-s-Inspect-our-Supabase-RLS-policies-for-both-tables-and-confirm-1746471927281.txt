Your Task

Diagnose the root cause(s):
Inspect our Supabase RLS policies for both tables and confirm that the signed-in user can SELECT their own row in public.business_profiles.
Verify that the Replit-hosted env variables (NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL, NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY, or service key) are correct and being loaded before any Supabase operations.
Audit our Supabase client instantiation and auth listener logic to ensure we handle token refresh and session rehydration properly.
Confirm that the foreign key relationship between users.id and business_profiles.user_id is always maintained (no orphaned rows).
Short-term fixes:
Add logging around each Supabase call to capture which queries succeed or fail, and the current session state (supabase.auth.getSession()).
Implement a fallback data-fetch routine that retries once upon token expiry errors.
Temporarily relax RLS policies to debug whether permissions are blocking data, then re-apply strict policies once you identify the issue.
Long-term architectural repairs:
Propose a unified data-layer service module (e.g., /lib/supabaseClient.ts) that centralizes all auth and data-fetch logic, ensuring a single source of truth for session handling.
Design a clear data-contract for our front end: how and when the profile object is populated, with TypeScript interfaces for both User and BusinessProfile, and a merged FullProfile.
Recommend adding database constraints (foreign keys, NOT NULL, and unique indexes) to enforce data integrity between auth users and business profiles.
Suggest a CI check or a pre-deployment script that runs a smoke test against Supabase (e.g., using the service key) to verify that RLS policies allow expected queries.
Outline best practices for environment management on Replit (e.g., locking required env vars, staging vs. prod keys) to prevent accidental misconfiguration.
Deliverables

A written report of your findings: root causes, affected code paths, and RLS policy audits.
A patched code diff (or PR) for the short-term fixes (instrumented logging, retry logic).
A high-level design doc for the long-term architecture changes (data-layer service, DB constraints, CI checks).
A migration plan to apply these changes with zero downtime and clear rollback steps.
Please treat this as a high-priority maintenance ticketâ€”our user onboarding flow is currently unstable. Let me know if you need any additional context (code snippets, table schemas, or logs).
