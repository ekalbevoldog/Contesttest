Comprehensive Technical Prompt for Building Contested on Replit
Project Overview
Create an end-to-end AI-driven SaaS platform called "Contested" that connects small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) with mid-tier athletes for marketing partnerships. The platform should use sophisticated AI algorithms to match businesses with athletes across multiple categories including NCAA, minor leagues, Olympic sports in non-marquee categories, esports competitors, and athletes from secondary professional leagues.
